        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          Leam Geeks is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for
          everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or expression, sexual
          orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race,
          nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of
          community members in any form.
        </p>
        <p>Our code of conduct is formed of 3 parts;</p>
        <ol>

          <li>A full explanation of the terms and actions we will take</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Participants found violating or we suspect have violated this code of
          conduct will be warned and may be sanctioned or expelled from the
          community at the discretion of the Leam Geeks organisers.
        </p>

            We will respond promptly to all reports of misconduct with our full
            attention
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Your Promise</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You will treat everyone with respect and generally how you would
            want to be treated
          </li>
          <li>You will not harass other attendees</li>
          <li>You will refrain from using offensive language and imagery</li>
          <li>
            You will report any derogatory or offensive behaviour to an
            organiser in person, via Twitter DM, Signal DM or meetup.com.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will fully read and adhere to the code of conduct at Leam Geeks
            events
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Full Explanation</h3>
        <p>
          Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to
          sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability,
          physical appearance, age, body size, race, nationality, or religious
          beliefs, deliberate intimidation, threats, stalking, following,
          harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or
          other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
          attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Leam Geeks
          event or communication channel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Community members asked to stop any forbidden behaviour are expected
          to comply immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a community member engages in forbidden behaviour, the Leam Geeks
          organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
          warning the offender, expulsion from the Leam Geeks community, and/or
          bringing the event to a close.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
          or have any other concerns, please contact a Leam Geeks organizer
          immediately, or as soon as you feel comfortable doing so.
        </p>
